### 

I recently completed my master's degree at <a href="https://mila.quebec/en/">Mila</a> and am currently enrolled in various research projects.
 

My current goal is to advance my expertise in applied deep learning, with a specific emphasis on large-scale deployment. The engineering complexities involved in handling large neural networks like ChatGPT or DALL-E, both during training for knowledge acquisition and during inference to cater to millions of global users, demand a sophisticated skill set.I believe that the ability to implement cutting-edge deep learning research at scale will play a pivotal role in the forthcoming technological revolution and that is what I am focusing on currently.
